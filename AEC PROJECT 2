/** You are given the height H (in metres) and mass M (in kilograms).The Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person is computed as M/H^2 .
*Report the category into which a person falls, based on his BMI:
	*Category 1: Underweight if BMI ≤18
	*Category 2: Normal weight ifBMI ∈\{19, 20,…, 24\}
	*Category 3: Overweight if BMI ∈\{25, 26,…, 29\}
	*Category 4: Obesity if BMI ≥30


*Input:
*The first line of input will contain an integer, TT, which denotes the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
*Each testcase contains a single line of input, with two space separated integers, M, HM,H, which denote the mass and height of Agastya respectively.
*Output:
 *For each testcase, output in a single line, 1, 2, 31,2,3 or 44, based on the category in which Agastya falls.
*Constraints
 *1≤T≤2*10^4
*1 ≤ M ≤ 10^4  
*1≤H≤10^2 
*It is guaranteed that H^2 divides M.
